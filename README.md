The fundamental requirement of this project is to implement an error control protocol by using Stop-and-wait(SAW) and Go-Back-N(GBN) algorithms.

This is a Three-member project first we need to develop protocol design, and then we need to preform both SAW and GBN independently. Implementation must provide full duplex communication. It means program should able to do sending and receiving at the same time and every individual program need to communicate with another team membersâ€™ program based on SAW to SAW and GBN to GBN.
